Did you see [The Scene](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2201890/)? No? Sorry for you. Cool movie, with original concept, and while it's original and strange it still looks interesting (by suprise!). II need a post for this movie (i have some thoughts about it). 

So, i have just looked episode 13 (the most geeky episode by now). And learned some interesting command for windows shell lol :). **forcedel** - deletes file even if it is used by some process.

I will try it when will be on Windows. Interesting, how the program will crashed that writing for this file for example :).
