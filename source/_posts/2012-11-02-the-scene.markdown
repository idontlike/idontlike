Did you see [The Scene](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2201890/)? What a pity. Very unique movie. May be i will write a post about this and all i think about this. But is it in format of the blog?

So, i have just looked episode 13 (the most geeky episode for now). And learned some interesting command for windows shell lol :). **forcedel** - deletes file even if it is used by some process.

I will try it when will be on Windows. Interesting, how the program will crashed that writing for this file for example :).
