Did you see [The Scene](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2201890/)? You should get a try. It is very original, looks geeky, but instead of all this it is still interesting (that is suprising).
I have some thoughts about the movie and should share in a separate post.

So, i have just looked episode 13 (the most geeky episode by now). And learned some interesting command for windows shell lol :). `forcedel` - deletes file even if it is used by some process.

I will try it when will be on Windows. Interesting, how programs crash trying to write to the file that is deleted unexpectedly.
